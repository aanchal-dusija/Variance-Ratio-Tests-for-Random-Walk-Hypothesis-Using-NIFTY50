# Variance Ratio Tests for Random Walk Hypothesis Using NIFTY50
This repository presents the comprehensive study and analysis of the "Variance Ratio Tests for Random Walk Hypothesis Using NIFTY50". This project aims to test the weak form of market efficiency in the stocks of NIFTY50 by applying variance ratio tests.

## Project Overview
The central focus of this research is to examine the efficiency of the stock market, particularly whether the stock prices in NIFTY50 reflect all available information and follow a random walk. This is crucial for understanding market predictability and for formulating investment strategies.

## Objectives and Scope
1. Understanding Market Efficiency: Exploring the concept of market efficiency and its implications for stock market behavior.
2. Variance Ratio Test: Utilizing Lo and MacKinlay's (1988) variance ratio test to evaluate if the returns in NIFTY50 follow a random walk hypothesis.
3. Data Analysis: Analyzing daily market capitalization and average daily turnover of NIFTY50 stocks over a three-month period, from December 2019 to March 2020.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection: Extracting data from Reuters, focusing on market capitalization and average daily turnover.
2. Statistical Analysis: Implementing variance ratio tests to the collected data using RStudio, with detailed steps and calculations included.
3. Interpretation of Results: Analyzing the variance ratio values and their implications for market efficiency across different deciles.

## Key Findings
1. Our analysis suggests a significant association between the size and liquidity of a company with market efficiency.
2. The results indicate that stocks in NIFTY50 generally exhibit market efficiency, implying that past movements in stock prices cannot reliably predict future movements.
3. A tendency for mean reversion was observed in several instances, providing insights into the dynamic nature of stock prices in NIFTY50.

## Repository Contents
1. Research Paper: A detailed document explaining the study's background, methodology, analysis, and conclusions.
2. Data Sets: The raw data used for analysis, including market capitalization and turnover values.
3. R Scripts: Custom scripts used for performing variance ratio tests and statistical analysis.
4. Supplementary Materials: Additional resources and references that support the research.


## Limitations and Future Scope
The study is limited to a three-month period, and extending this to a longer duration could provide more robust insights.
Future research may include comparing these findings with other stock indices or incorporating other statistical models for a comprehensive analysis.
